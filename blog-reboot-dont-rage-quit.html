                    Sometimes your system just needs a restart, not a shutdown.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are times when life feels like a frozen screen, when nothing moves, nothing responds, and all you want to do is hit "shut down" and walk away. But just like a developer faced with a crashing system, sometimes all you really need is a reboot. This is not just philosophy, it's my story, and I hope it reminds you: you are not alone, and you are not broken.
                </p>

                <h2>🧠 From an Extrovert to a Silent System</h2>
                <p>
                    I was once that high-spirited, extroverted soul. The one who could talk to anyone, smile without effort, and radiate confidence. But life doesn't always follow a linear roadmap. During my +2 years (Class 11 and 12), those crucial, defining academic years, I was hit hard. Not by just academic pressure, but by a flood of severe depression and anxiety.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Assignments piled up like unsolved errors. The trauma of past life events mixed with the overwhelming deadlines of the present. 
                    The cheerful voice in my head? Silenced. I had to attend counseling sessions on alternate days just to stay functional. 
                    And despite trying, I couldn't perform well academically. I scored lower than expected, a D in math, 
                    and a B+ in overall. Not what you'd expect from someone who once dreamed big.
                </p>

                <h2>🔄 The Real Class Begins After Class</h2>
                <p>
                    But here's the truth no curriculum teaches you: Life doesn't end with grades, it starts with perspective.
                    Those tough years taught me things no textbook ever could. Pain became my teacher. Struggle became my syllabus. 
                    I learned what it means to be human, what it means to fall apart, and how to rebuild.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And rebuild, I did.
                </p>

                <h2>💡 Version 2.0: Stronger, Smarter, Happier</h2>
                <p>
                    Fast-forward 1.5 to 2 years after +2, and I feel like a fully recompiled version of myself. Not perfect, but optimized, debugged, and stable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From being anxious and introverted, I'm now confident, socially open, and mentally strong.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>My public speaking? Sharp.</li>
                    <li>My leadership and communication skills? Consistently improving.</li>
                    <li>From getting D in math, I now score 99 and 100 in mathematics in my Bachelor's, almost unbelievable, but very real.</li>
                    <li>From the guy who doubted himself, I've become a good student, someone my peers respect and rely on.</li>
                    <li>I even closed my first deal at iFiCode, my own coding agency, and landed several successful projects with my dropshipping e-commerce platform, Freedom Bazar.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I'm not saying this to boast. I'm saying this because I was once the person who felt like quitting, and now I'm the person who's thriving.
                </p>

                <h2>👨‍💻 Mental Health Is Not a Bug: It's Part of the System</h2>
                <p>
                    We developers know that systems hang. Projects fail. Code breaks. And that doesn't mean we trash the whole machine, it just means we debug, rework, and restart.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mental health is no different. Anxiety and depression are not failures, they're signals. Like console logs telling you something needs attention. You're not broken, you're just in need of a reboot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And rebooting doesn't make you weak. It makes you resilient.
                </p>

                <h2>💬 Final Thoughts: Keep Committing to Yourself</h2>
                <p>
                    So, to whoever's reading this:
                    If you're in a dark place right now, I've been there. If you feel like quitting, don't. Rage quitting is for games, not life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Take that break. Talk to someone. Go to therapy. Cry if you have to. But always come back. Because your next version could be the best one yet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every system deserves a second chance.
                    So do you.
                    Keep pushing commits, your best build is on the way.
                </p>
