                    Sometimes your system just needs a restart ‚Äî not a shutdown.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are times when life feels like a frozen screen ‚Äî when nothing moves, nothing responds, and all you want to do is hit "shut down" and walk away. But just like a developer faced with a crashing system, sometimes all you really need is a reboot. This is not just philosophy ‚Äî it's my story, and I hope it reminds you: you are not alone, and you are not broken.
                </p>

                <h2>üß† From an Extrovert to a Silent System</h2>
                <p>
                    I was once that high-spirited, extroverted soul. The one who could talk to anyone, smile without effort, and radiate confidence. But life doesn't always follow a linear roadmap. During my +2 years (Class 11 and 12) ‚Äî those crucial, defining academic years ‚Äî I was hit hard. Not by just academic pressure, but by a flood of severe depression and anxiety.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Assignments piled up like unsolved errors. The trauma of past life events mixed with the overwhelming deadlines of the present. The cheerful voice in my head? Silenced. I had to attend counseling sessions on alternate days just to stay functional. And despite trying, I couldn't perform well academically. I scored lower than expected ‚Äî a D in math, and a B+ overall in the Nepali grading system. Not what you'd expect from someone who once dreamed big.
                </p>

                <h2>üîÑ The Real Class Begins After Class</h2>
                <p>
                    But here's the truth no curriculum teaches you: Life doesn't end with grades ‚Äî it starts with perspective.
                    Those tough years taught me things no textbook ever could. Pain became my teacher. Struggle became my syllabus. I learned what it means to be human, what it means to fall apart ‚Äî and how to rebuild.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And rebuild, I did.
                </p>

                <h2>üí° Version 2.0 ‚Äî Stronger, Smarter, Happier</h2>
                <p>
                    Fast-forward 1.5 to 2 years after +2, and I feel like a fully recompiled version of myself. Not perfect ‚Äî but optimized, debugged, and stable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From being anxious and introverted, I'm now confident, socially open, and mentally strong.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>My public speaking? Sharp.</li>
                    <li>My leadership and communication skills? Consistently improving.</li>
                    <li>From getting D in math, I now score 99 and 100 in mathematics in my Bachelor's ‚Äî almost unbelievable, but very real.</li>
                    <li>From the guy who doubted himself, I've become a good student, someone my peers respect and rely on.</li>
                    <li>I even closed my first deal at iFiCode, my own coding agency ‚Äî and landed several successful projects with my dropshipping e-commerce platform, Freedom Bazar.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I'm not saying this to boast. I'm saying this because I was once the person who felt like quitting, and now I'm the person who's thriving.
                </p>

                <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Mental Health Is Not a Bug ‚Äî It's Part of the System</h2>
                <p>
                    We developers know that systems hang. Projects fail. Code breaks. And that doesn't mean we trash the whole machine ‚Äî it just means we debug, rework, and restart.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mental health is no different. Anxiety and depression are not failures ‚Äî they're signals. Like console logs telling you something needs attention. You're not broken ‚Äî you're just in need of a reboot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And rebooting doesn't make you weak. It makes you resilient.
                </p>

                <h2>üí¨ Final Thoughts: Keep Committing to Yourself</h2>
                <p>
                    So, to whoever's reading this:
                    If you're in a dark place right now, I've been there. If you feel like quitting ‚Äî don't. Rage quitting is for games, not life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Take that break. Talk to someone. Go to therapy. Cry if you have to. But always come back. Because your next version could be the best one yet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every system deserves a second chance.
                    So do you.
                    Keep pushing commits ‚Äî your best build is on the way.
                </p>
